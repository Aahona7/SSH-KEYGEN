SSH (Secure Shell):

SSH is a protocol used for secure remote sessions and communication between a client and server.

Default Port: SSH typically operates on port 22.

Example: If my office is located in the city and the office server contains the files and directories 
I need for my work, I don't need to physically travel to the office. 
Instead, I can remotely access the server from home to work with those files and directories. 
Various tools and packages are available for remote sessions, such as RDP for Windows, PuTTY, and Telnet.

SSH-KEYGEN:

SSH-KEYGEN is a tool used to generate a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key.
Analogy: This is similar to WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption. 
The public key is used to encrypt a message, turning it into cipher text or a "salted" address, 
while the private key is used to decrypt that cipher text back into the original message. 
Cracking this type of encryption is extremely difficult, taking an estimated 100 to 500 years.

Logging in with SSH:
Initially, when logging into a machine using SSH, you are prompted to enter a password for authentication.
However, after setting up SSH key-based authentication, you won't be asked for a password when logging in.

How SSH Works:

1.First, we generate a pair of keys (public and private) on our local machine.
2.We then share our public key with the server for identification.
3.The server uses this public key to identify our credentials and sends back an authentication message securely encrypted.
4.This encrypted message can only be opened with our private key.
5.After successful authentication, a secure tunnel is established.
6.All data transmitted through this tunnel is encrypted, ensuring security during transmission.
7.Once the SSH key-based authentication is set up, future logins will not require a password, 
as the private key automatically provides the necessary authentication.
